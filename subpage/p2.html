            A Music Recommendation System is an application of Data Science that aims to assist users in discovering new and
            relevant musical content based on their preferences and listening behavior.

            Personalized music recommendations have become an essential tool in the digital music landscape, enabling music
            streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to offer personalized and engaging experiences to their users. This project walks through the steps to build a music recommendation system using Spotify API and Python.

            Music Recommendation Systems operate through intricate algorithms that analyze vast amounts of data about usersâ€™ musical
            interactions, such as their listening history, liked tracks, skipped songs, and even explicit user preferences conveyed
            through ratings or feedback.
