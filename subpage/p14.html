            RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and
            segmenting customers based on their buying behavior.         
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 mx-auto text-start container">
              Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers’:
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              - recency (the date they made their last purchase)
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              - frequency (how often they make purchases)
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 mx-auto text-start container">
              - monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 mx-auto text-start container">
            Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer
            engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

            To build an analytics dashboard using Python, we can use the plotly dash framework. Dash is a productive Python
            framework for building web analytical applications. It’s built on top of Plotly.js and React.js.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 mx-auto text-start container">
            It offers a simple interface for creating interactive, web-based dashboards. It is highly customizable and can produce
            very sophisticated and interactive dashboards. Dash applications are web servers running Flask and communicating JSON
            packets over HTTP requests.
