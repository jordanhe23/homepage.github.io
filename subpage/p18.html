            Car insurance modelling refers to the use of statistical and mathematical models to accurately predict events such as
            the frequency of claims, the severity of claims, or the total cost associated with claims, which in turn helps in
            pricing insurance products, managing risk, and optimizing business strategies.

              Below is the process we can follow for the task of Car Insurance Modelling:
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              1. Understand what the business aims to achieve with the model, whether itâ€™s reducing risk, optimizing pricing, increasing
              competitiveness, or a combination of objectives.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              2. Collect data from internal systems (claims history, customer records) and external sources (public vehicle records,
              geographic information systems).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            3. Create new features that might be predictive of risk or claim cost, such as aggregating past claims to calculate claim
            frequency or severity.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            4. Choose appropriate statistical or machine learning algorithms based on the problem characteristics. Common choices might
            include linear regression, generalized linear models, decision trees, or ensemble methods.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            5. Ensure that the model meets business objectives and risk thresholds.
