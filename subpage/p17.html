            Anomalies in the stock market are important because they can indicate opportunities or risks. For example, a sudden
            spike in a stockâ€™s price could be due to positive news about the company or its industry, which signals a potential
            investment opportunity. Conversely, an unexpected price drop could warn of underlying issues or market sentiment
            changes, which signals a risk that investors may need to manage.

              Below is the process for the task of stock market anomaly detection:
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              -  Gather historical stock market data, including prices (open, high, low, close, adjusted close) and trading volumes.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              -  Develop additional features that may help in detecting anomalies, such as moving averages, relative strength index
              (RSI), or percentage changes over specific periods.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            -  Visualize the data to identify potential outliers or unusual patterns across time.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            -  Employ statistical methods like Z-score analysis, where data points that are a certain number of standard deviations
            away from the mean are flagged as anomalies.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            -  Use the insights gained from anomaly detection to inform investment decisions, risk management, and strategic planning.
          </p>
