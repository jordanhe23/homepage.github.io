            Multivariate Time Series Forecasting involves predicting future values of multiple time-dependent variables using
            historical data. Unlike univariate time series forecasting, which predicts a single variable (e.g., sales over time),
            multivariate forecasting considers several variables simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 mx-auto text-start container">
            Multivariate Time Series Forecasting is preferable when the variables may have dependencies or interactions with one
            another. The goal is to capture these interdependencies to make accurate predictions for each variable over a future
            time period. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Multivariate Time Series Forecasting:
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              1. Determine which variables are relevant to the forecast. Besides the target variable you want to predict, identify other
              variables that might influence it.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              2. Collect historical data for all variables identified. This data should cover a sufficient time period to capture
              seasonal patterns, trends, and any cyclical behaviour.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              3. Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the data. It might involve imputation, data smoothing, or anomaly
              detection techniques.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              4. Use plots and charts to understand relationships between variables, identify trends, and detect seasonality or cyclic
              patterns.
          </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            5. Select and use forecasting models suitable for multivariate time series data. Options include Vector Auto Regression
            (VAR), State Space Models (like Kalman Filters), and machine learning approaches such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
            networks.
