            Health Monitoring and Analysis refers to the systematic use of health data to track and evaluate the health status of
            individuals or populations over time. It contains a range of activities from real-time physiological data collection
            (like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) to the analysis of more complex health records (including patient
            history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information). In this exercise, we will provide:

              <b>Identified Clusters:</b> Distinct patient groups based on health metrics, each with unique characteristics that provide
              insight into their specific health needs.

          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              <b>Personalized Health Insights:</b> Enhanced understanding of patient health requirements and risks, enabling tailored
              intervention strategies.

              <b>Improved Health Monitoring:</b> Recommendations for targeted monitoring and intervention strategies that cater to the
              specific needs of each cluster, leading to more effective health management and better patient outcomes.
