            Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis involves examining all the costs associated with delivering food orders,
            from direct expenses like delivery fees and packaging to indirect expenses like discounts offered to customers and
            commission fees paid by restaurants. By juxtaposing these costs against the revenue generated (primarily through order
            values and commission fees), the analysis aims to provide insights into how profitable the food delivery service is on a
            per-order basis.
            
            Below is the process we can follow for the task of Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis:
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              1. Start by gathering comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              2. Clean the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              3. Extract relevant features that could impact cost and profitability.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
              4. Break down the costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like
              delivery fees and discounts).
          </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            5. Determine the revenue generated from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            6. For each order, calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue. Analyze the distribution of
            profitability across all orders to identify trends.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            7. Based on the cost and profitability analysis, develop strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing profitability.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mx-auto text-start container">
            8. Use the data to simulate the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.
