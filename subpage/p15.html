            Statistical modelling is a form of mathematical modelling that involves statistics to estimate or predict real-world
            behaviours, trends, and future outcomes based on data. It involves the construction of a statistical model, which is a
            formal representation of relationships between variables, typically expressed in the form of mathematical equations.

              Statistical modelling is a mathematical framework used to describe the relationships between variables in the form of
              equations, usually involving stochastic elements (randomness). It is primarily focused on inference, which means
              understanding the relationships between variables and quantifying how certain factors influence outcomes.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 mx-auto text-start container">
              Statistical models are built based on assumptions about the data distributions and the nature of the relationships
              between variables. Common examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).

              The difference between statistical modelling and machine learning model training is that statistical modelling is
              primarily concerned with inference. It seeks to understand the underlying relationships between variables and to
              quantify how predictors influence the response variable. It often tests hypotheses about these relationships.
